// ## ES6 Basics

// 1. Take these arrays `[1,10,5]` and `[6,2,8]` and combine them using spread syntax.

let firstArray = [1, 10, 5]
let secondArray = [6, 2, 8]

// 2. Make a shallow copy of the array and save it into a new variable.

let thirdArray = [...firstArray, ...secondArray]

// 3. Using arrow functions, sort the newly copied array to appear in numerical order.

// 4. Log both the original array and the sorted array to the console to make sure they appear correctly.

// ## Classes

// 1. Create a class that could be used to represent all animals. Provide it with the attributes that you see fit and a constructor that takes in information to provide said attributes. The class should also have at least one function that allows the animal to make a noise.

// 2. Create two sub classes (using the 'extends' keyword) of your animal class. One should represent as a cat and one should represent a snake. Re-evaluate the way you structured your parent class to see if any work will need to be done to adjust the parent class.

// 3. Create 2 different sub-classes for cats and 2 different sub-classes for snakes. Make sure that they are different but still have all of the same attributes that their parent and ancestor classes have.
